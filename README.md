This is a creature collector game.
The game will be written with a python backend, and we may eventually have a web frontend. Use Streamlit for the python backend.
It is single player for now, but we might eventually add multiplayer battles.
There will be turn-based battles, where the player can select one of many possible actions for their creature, and when attacking there is a real-time event to test the player's skill.
There will be pixel-art sprites for the creatures.
There will be gacha mechanics outside of battle, for items, but not for creatures.
There will be a way to combine creatures, with predictable special combinations that create cool creatures.
